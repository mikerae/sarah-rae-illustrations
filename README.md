# Agile Development
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

The Agile design process was used to some for this limited project.
## Platform
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

The GitHub platform was used to facilitate Agile Development:
## User Stories - Github Issues
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

- User stories were derived from discussions with Sarah Rae and notated as Github [issues](#) These user stories were refined from 'epic' to more specific user-stories.
- For some user stories, Predicted Project Effort was defined, with story points being allocated to some user stories. 
- Issues were prioritised according to Moscow principles. Github Labels were used mark user stories accordingly.
    - Must have: < 60% of total story points in iteration
    - Should have: the rest
    - Could have: 20% of total story points in iteration
    - Won't have
### Bugs
Bugs were recorded as issues, and the progress towards resolution of these issues was tracked.
### Tests
Tests were recorded as issues, and their results were tracked.
## Information Radiators
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

Information Radiators were used to monitor the progress of the project development.
- A Github [Project](#)  was used to hold all user stories for processing and allocation in a Kanban Board. User stories were allocated to the Project and their progress tracked through the following stages:
    - New Issue
    - Backlog
    - Ready
    - In Progress
    - In Review (Used when a branch pull-request was made)
    - Done
- Github [Milestones](#) were used to define sprint content.
## Backlog
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

The GitHub [Project](#) was used to hold user stories and other issues which were not allocated to the current sprint.
## Sprints - Github Milestones
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

- [Sprints](#) were defined to define development tasks needed to bring the project to Minimum Viable Product level. Other Github Milestones were used to hold user stories allocated to these sprints.

- A virtual environment was used to ensure compatibility in deployment. A template containing all standard project requirements was prepared by the Code Institute.
- The environment was updated with additional requirements by downloading them into the environment via the terminal, and the requirements.txt file was updated using the following code:
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
## Version Control
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

### Git
Git was used for version control
### GitHub
GitHub was used for external project code storage and display
## GitHub Repository
### Github template
- A gitHub repository was created using a required Code Institute template.
- Issue Templates
- Milestones
- Project Kanban board
## GitPod Workspace
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

## Git Version Control
### Commits
### Issue Tracking
### Branches
### Pull Requests
### Branch Merges

## Setting Up Local Development Environment
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)
### Libraries
The following libraries were installed in the GitPod workspace:

The details of the currently installed libraries were stored in the file requirements.txt so that the deployment platform can load them when the project is deployed in production:

```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
The current requirements used are:

```xxx```
### Creating a Django Project
A Django project was created:

``` $ python3 django-admin startproject <project-name> ```

A Local sql database was automatically created
### Creating a project superuser
### Creating Apps
Apps were created as required using:

``` $ python3 manage.py startapp <app name>```

The  app was added to the list of installed apps in the settings.py file
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'app-name',
]
```
### Database Migrations
As models were created and changed, the changes were recorded in a set of sequential django records called 'migrations' and then applied to the database modelsm either localy or remotely.
#### Make Migrations
The changes to the Django database were recorded by making migration records. First, a dry run was used to expose any errors in creating th records:

```$ python3 manage.py makemigrations -- dry-run ```

```$ python3 manage.py makemigrations```
#### Migrate
``` $ python3 manage.py migrate --plan ```

# Testing
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)
### Incremental Feature Testing
As each feature was added, it was tested manually to ensure that it behaved as desired.
#### Manual Testing
The following manual tests were made:
- [Test Log 1](#)
- [Test Log 2](#)
- [Test Log 3](#)
### Automatic Testing
No automatic testing was used for the MVP.
Future versions will have full django unit and integration testing.
#### Human Testing
No human testing was done for the MVP.
Feedback from the site owner and customers will be used to develop future versions.

# Validation
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)
Validators were used to ensure that all aspects of the code was 'clean' according to industry standards.
## Python PEP8CI 
Python code
The code was tested using PEP8CI online http:# and passed without issue.
- [CI Python Linter](#)
## Pylint VSCODE linter
The pylint linter was used throughout development to ensure that problematic code was corrected as it was writen.

A number of the lines in the settings.py file were raising a linting error because they were too long for standard use in a terminal. Since these settings were not going to be visible in a terminal, the errors were suppressed by adding the following to the end of the long line:
```
  # noqa E501
```

There were several instances where the VSCode Pylint identified that some objects had no members associated with them. These objects were, in fact, populated and accessable. This error message was disables by placing the following code at the the top of a file which generated this error.
```
# pylint: disable=no-member
```

The state of the currently deployed python code shows minor issues:
- [Pylint Output]()

## JavaScript
JSHint was used to validate javascript code.
- [JSHint results may be viewd here:](#)
## HTML
The W3C NU html validator was used. 1 information element originating in allauth code was exposed. Otherwise the code passed without issue.
- [W3C HTML Validator 1](#)
- [W3C HTML Validator 2](#)
- [W3C HTML Validator 3](#)
- [W3C HTML Validator 4](#)
- [W3C HTML Validator 5](#)

# Deployment
[Back to Top](#sarah-rae-illustrations)

The project was deployed to Heroku in the initial stages of development in order to resolve early and fundamental deployment issues.
### Deployed App Cloud Server: Heruko
Heroku was used to deploy the django project backend

### Cloud Database: ElephantSql
ElephantSql was used for data storage

### Cloud Static and Media Server: AWS3

#### Add Heroku Host Name in Settings.py
- in ALLOWED_HOSTS add the heroku app name
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['string-rota.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
#### Create 3 directories in the top level directory, next to manage.py
- 'media'
- 'static'
- 'templates'
#### Create a Procfile
This tells Heroku that thew app will be displayed using the gunicorn webserver
- Create 'Procfile' at the top level, next to manage.py
```
web: gunicorn django_string_rota.wsgi
```
#### Push to GitHub and connect repository to Heroku
- Push to git hub
- In Heroku, string-rota:
    - Click on 'Deploy"
    - Select GitHub Connect to Github
    - Select the string-rota repository
    - choose auomatic deployment

#### Create app on Heroku
The app "string-rota" was created on Heroku by:
- Logging into Heroku
- Clicking on New
    - Click "Create new app"
- Giving the app a unique name.
    - "string-rota" was accepted as unique
- The region was chosen as:
    - Europe
- The app was created:
    - Click "Create app"

#### Create database on ElephantSQL
The database "string-rota" was created on ElephantSQL by:
- Logging into ElephantSQL
- Click on "Create New Instance"
- The plan was named "string-rota"
- The plan type was " Tiny Turtle (Free)
- Click on "Select Region"
- "EU-West-1 (Ireland)" was selected by default
- Click on "Review"
- Click on "Create Instance"

#### Store database environment variables in env.py
- create a file "env.py" at the top directory in the workspace, at the same level as requirements.txt
- ensure that "env.py" is added to .gitignore so that it's sensitive contents are not pushed to github.
- In env.py
    - Import the os library
    - Add the DATABASE URL to the environment

        ``` 
        import os
        os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "<copiedURL>"
        ```
    where "copiedURL" is replaced by the copied elephantSQL "string-rota" URL

    - Add a secret key to the environment
        ```
        os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "my_super^secret@key"
        ```
#### Modify settings.py
- The following code was added to the settings.py file below PATH import:
```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```
- Replace the insecure Django SECRET_KEY with the env.py SECRET_KEY
```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```
- Comment out the default database url variable (which would have connected Django to the internal db.sqlite3 database) and add a link to the env.py database url (the ElephantSQL remote database)
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```
#### Migrate changes to django database
```
gitpod /workspace/string-rota (main) $ python3 manage.py migrate
```
#### Test connection with remote ElephantSQL database
- In the dashboard for ElephantSQL (logged in)
    - select "string-rota" instance
    - on the left menu
        - select BROWSER
        - select 'Table queries'
            - observe the dropdown is populated. This means that tables have been created by django in this database, and that the connection between django and the database is made.
#### Add Environment Variables to Heroku
- In 'string-rota'
    - Click on 'Reveal Config Vars'
    - Add the following KEYS and their corresponding VALUES (without "")from env.py:
        - DATABASE_URL
        - SECRET_KEY
        - PORT 8000

####  data to Django db.sql and ElephantSql
##### Initial Data Loading
Initial data was imported into the project using set_up.py and associated utilities. This data was available from a spreadsheet stored in googledocs. set_up.py securely logged into the sreadsheet and retrieved the required data, then loaded the data into the models in the correct order.
#### Subsequent Data Loading
Once a credible starting data set was established, this data set was dumped into a db.json file in the fixtures dir using the following command.

```
python manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes --indent 4 > db.json
```
When the local  database needed to be reset:
- The db.sql file was deleted
- Migrations were run
- The db.json file was loaded using Loaddata

When the remote database needed to be reset:
- The database dashboard was accessed from the ElephantSql site
- The database was reset
- DEVEPLOPMENT variable was commented out in  env.py 
- Migrations were run
- The db.json file was loaded using Loaddata
#### Add AWS Environment Variable
- In created AWS Account
    - Copy 
- In env.py
    - add environment variable:
    ```
    os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "copied_url"
    ```
- In Heroku Config Vars
    - Add CLOUDINARY_URL: copied_url
#### Add Temporary Config Var to Heroku
There are no static files yet, and without the following variable set, the build will fail on Heroku.
Once static files are introduced into the project, this variable can be removed.
- DISABLE_COLLECTSATICK:1
#### Update Installed Apps and media/ static files in settings.py
The deployment platform, Heroku, is ephemeral i.e. when it is not being used, it stops running actively and any state data is lost. It is necessary, therefore, to store static files in a permanent state location. For this project, Amazon AWS3 was used as the permanent storage location for the static and media files.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   
]
```
- below STATIC_URL = '/static/'  add the following:
```

```
#### Add a Templates Directory in settings.py
- under BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent add the following:
```
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
```
- in TEMPLATES give 'DIRS' the value 'TEMPLATES'
```
TEMPLATES = [
   
]
```
#### Build, deploy and open app on Heroku
After some trouble-shooting (see bugs and fixes) the default Django landing page was shown on the Heroku deployed site.

#### Deployment Process
The project was deployed to the Heroku platform using the following steps:
- Delete unused resources/libraries
- Add \n to input line
- pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
- commit & push to gitHub
- make Heroku account
- create new app (in Heroku)
- in dashboard : open settings
- in settings : open config vars
    - add config vars
- in deploy
    - choose deployment method
        - GitHub

        - choose a deployment method (Enable Automatic Deploys)
        - main branch
        - click view to open a web page with the deployment in a browser

#### Freeze requirements
Before deployment, the imported libraries were frozen into the requirement.txt file so that they could be available in the deployed virtual environment. The following code was used:
```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
### Final Deployment
The following additional steps were taken before final deployment
- The GitHub Repository was made public
- Django debug mode was set to FALSE
